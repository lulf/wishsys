Wishsys is a simple web app in Haskell that can be used to maintain a wish list,
having administrators that can put stuff into the list, and guests that can
register purchases of those wishes.

The view of the administrators and guests are separated, so that the
administrators cannot see what the guests have purchased.

To use:
* Edit src/Config.hs with the desired users.
* Initialize sqlite db with "sqlite3 config/wishsys.db < schema.db"
* Run cabal install to create the snaplet, and just run with 'wishsys -p <portnumber>'

To populate with users, use snap-auth-cli (https://github.com/dzhus/snap-auth-cli/)
