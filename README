Wishsys is a simple web app in Haskell that can be used to maintain a wish list,
having administrators that can put stuff into the list, and guests that can
register purchases of those wishes.

The view of the administrators and guests are separated, so that the
administrators cannot see what the guests have purchased.

To use:
* You need to edit config/sqlite.yml and config/settings.yml to configure  it to your liking.
* Just compile it using cabal and run it.
* The default web interface supports registering multiple wish lists.
